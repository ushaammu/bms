    <h1> WHY CHATBOT ?</h1>
    <p>A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation with an end user. Though not all chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), modern chatbots increasingly use conversational AI techniques like natural language processing (NLP) to understand the user’s questions and automate responses to them.<br>
        Chatbots can make it easy for users to find information by instantaneously responding to questions and requests—through text input, audio input, or both—without the need for human intervention or manual research.

        Chatbot technology is now commonplace, found everywhere from smart speakers at home to consumer-facing instances of SMS, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger to workplace messaging applications like Slack. The latest evolution of AI chatbots, often referred to as “intelligent virtual assistants” or “virtual agents,” can not only understand free-flowing conversation through use of sophisticated language models, but even automate relevant tasks. Alongside well-known consumer-facing intelligent virtual assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon Alexa, virtual agents are also increasingly used to in an enterprise context to assist customers and employees.</p>
